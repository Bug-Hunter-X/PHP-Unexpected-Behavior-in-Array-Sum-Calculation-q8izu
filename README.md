This repository contains a PHP function that calculates the sum of an array of numbers.  The function demonstrates a common coding error where the handling of empty arrays is not properly addressed. The `bug.php` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The solution handles empty arrays gracefully and includes input validation to prevent errors from non-numeric input.
